# STAR: An Informational Website for Career Paths

STAR stemmed from my desire of wanting to improve the overwhleming process of searching for your 'dream job'. Before I went to college, I spent a long time trying to decide what exactly my 'dream job' was. Unfortunately, that process was very difficult and time consuming. There were too many articles to read, videos to watch, and quizzes to take. That's why I came up with STAR. An all-encompassing informational database for individuals to search through various online resources to learn more about their interested career paths.  


### Narrowing the Scope
Because there are so many resources out there for learning about career paths, STAR strives to narrow the scope by focusing on providing information on career paths that don't require a college degree. As a result, STAR strives to address a specific audience: individuals who don't have a college degree and are currently in their career search journey. With the help from STAR, hopefully these individuals will gain better insights into what 'dream job' they'll want to pursue.

### STAR Features
STAR was designed for 3 workflows: exploring a career/career category, finding a community, and completing a career quiz.

### Technical Details
This repo contains an MVP of STAR, using mock data to simulate the web design of STAR. The techstack currently is React for the front-end (using Node.js as the framework), Tailwind CSS for styling, and TypeScript for the backend.
